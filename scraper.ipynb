Instead of receiving the promised tokens, those who authorized contracted their wallets to be emptied. One victim lost 36 NFTs, including a Bored Ape NFT they bought for about $130,000. In total, the attackers managed to steal between $750,000 and $900,000 worth of NFTs, depending on how the resale value was estimated. The next day, the Gutter Cat Gang announced that they had regained control of the Twitter account and deleted the malicious tweet. They said they were cooperating with law enforcement investigating the theft but, to the dismay of some victims, did not describe any plans to compensate those whose assets were lost.</p>\n",

To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.</p>\n",

To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.</p>\n",

In total, the attackers managed to steal between $750,000 and $900,000 worth of NFTs, depending on how the resale value was estimated. The next day, the Gutter Cat Gang announced that they had regained control of the Twitter account and deleted the malicious tweet. They said they were cooperating with law enforcement investigating the theft but, to the dismay of some victims, did not describe any plans to compensate those whose assets were lost.</p>\n",

To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.</p>\n",
