To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.\n",

He advertised the service on his website claiming that the promised returns matched the performance of his investments, as he himself was a white knuckle investor who had made millions of dollars. According to his trading strategy, Ichioka promised a 10% return every 30 business days to those who participated in his program. However, his trades suffered huge losses. To hide the losses, he provided false documents to inflate the amount of money in his commodity interest pool accounts and provided participants with false account statements. Ichioka also used other participants' funds to pay for the alleged gains. Although Ichioka claimed that he was investing for his clients, he actually used client funds for personal expenses. He commingled participants' assets with his own and used them to purchase luxury items such as jewelry, cars, and watches.\n",

      "Description of the event: Blockchain security researcher iczc tweeted that a vulnerability was found in Polygon zkEVM and received a bug bounty from Immunefi L2. The vulnerability prevents asset migration from L1 to L2 by preventing assets bridged from L1 to Polygon zkEVM (L2) from being properly claimed in L2. iczc found in the code logic of processing claim tx pre-execution results that malicious attackers can bypass the \"isReverted\" pre-execution check on claim transactions by setting the gas fee to non-zero, allowing them to send a large number of Low-cost claims DoS attacks on sequencers and validators, increasing computational overhead. Also, transactions are not immediately removed from the pool after execution. The status is updated from Pending to Selected and continues to exist in the PostgreSQL database. Currently, there is only one trusted sequencer capable of fetching transactions from the transaction pool and executing them. Therefore, another vulnerability is to maliciously mark any deposit amount by sending a failed transaction. This will cause claim transactions that correctly use credits to be rejected because the credits are already used. This makes the L2 network unusable for new users. The Polygon zkEVM team fixed this vulnerability by removing the specific gas logic for claiming transactions, with no funds at risk.\n",

      "Description of the event: According to The Block, cybersecurity firm Unciphered claims it was able to hack into hardware-encrypted wallets powered by Trezor T models. In a YouTube demo, Unciphered showed exploiting the wallet vulnerability to extract the mnemonic private key from the wallet, saying the attack is only feasible if the attacker has physical access to the hardware wallet. Trezor CTO Tomáš Sušánka responded: \"This appears to be a vulnerability called an RDP downgrade attack, which requires extremely sophisticated technical knowledge and advanced equipment. Even with the above conditions, Trezor can pass a powerful passphrase, making RDP downgrade attacks ineffective.” Trezor added that they have taken the important step of developing a new secure element for hardware wallets with their sister company Tropic Square to solve future problems.\n",

Data on the chain shows that the malicious verifier who attacked the MEV bots today has been punished by Slash and kicked out of the verifier queue. According to SlowMist analysis, the reason why the MEV bots was attacked was that even if the beacon block was incorrect, the relay still returned the payload to the proposer, which resulted in the proposer being able to access the content of the block before another block was finalized. The attacker takes advantage of this problem to maliciously construct an invalid block, so that the block cannot be verified, and the relay cannot broadcast (the status code is 202) to obtain the transaction content in advance. mev-boost-relay has urgently released a new version to alleviate this problem, and it is recommended that relay operators upgrade the relay in time.\n",

      "Description of the event: Safemoon, a DeFi protocol based on the BNB chain, was attacked, and its liquidity pool lost nearly $8.9 million. Safemoon CEO John Karony said on Twitter: \"This security incident affected the SFM:BNB LP pool and other LP pools on DEX were not affected. We have located the suspected vulnerability and fixed it. \" According to analysis, the recent update may have introduced a \"public destruction vulnerability\", which facilitated hacker attacks. The hacker was able to use code functionality to artificially inflate the price of SFM tokens, then sell enough tokens back to the liquidity pool in the same transaction, effectively draining WBNB from the contract. On April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, that is, transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, leaving the remaining 20% as a bounty.\n",

      "Description of the event: The DeFi lending protocol Euler Finance was attacked, and the attackers made a profit of about 197 million US dollars. The attacker used flashloans to deposit funds and then leveraged them twice to trigger the liquidation logic, donating the funds to the reserve address and conducting a self-liquidation to collect any remaining assets. Two key factors contributed to the success of the attack: 1. Funds were donated to the reserved address without being subjected to a liquidity check. This created a mechanism that could directly trigger soft liquidation. 2. When the soft liquidation logic was triggered by high leverage, the yield value increased, enabling the liquidator to obtain most of the collateral funds from the liquidated user's account by transferring only a portion of the liabilities to themselves. Given that the value of the collateral funds exceeded the value of the liabilities (which were only partially transferred due to the soft liquidation), the liquidator was able to successfully pass their health factor check (checkLiquidity) and withdraw the obtained funds. On April 4th, Euler Labs tweeted that after a successful negotiation, the attacker has returned all the funds stolen from the agreement on March 13th, because the attacker has returned the funds, the $1 million reward campaign launched by the foundation No new information will be accepted.\n",

      "Description of the event: Multichain's AnyswapV4Router contract suffered a rush attack, and the attacker made a profit of about 87 Ethereum, about $130,000. After analysis, the attacker used the MEV contract (0xd050) to pre-emptively call the anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit function of the AnyswapV4Router contract before the normal transaction was executed (the user authorized WETH but has not yet performed the transfer), although the function uses the permit signature of the token verification, but the stolen WETH this time does not have a relevant signature verification function, and only triggers a deposit function in a fallback. In subsequent function calls, the attacker can directly use the safeTransferFrom function to transfer the WETH authorized by the _underlying address to the attacked contract to the attack contract without signature verification.\n",

The phishing emails pretended to be from logistics provider DHL and cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask. The email posing as MetaMask stated that the recipient's account had been suspended and would need to complete a KYC verification process before it could be reactivated. The email also contained a Namecheap marketing link that redirected users to a fake MetaMask page that asked users to enter their seed phrase or private key, seeking to steal the recipient's personal information and cryptocurrency wallet assets. The official MetaMask response stated that MetaMask will not collect KYC information, nor will it send emails to users about their accounts.\n",

      "Description of the event: Encrypted KOL NFT God tweeted that due to hackers hacking into its Twitter, Substack, Gmail, Discord and wallets, it lost all its encrypted assets and NFTs, and the hackers also posted fraudulent links through the stolen accounts. The reason for being hacked was that the Ledger was set as a hot wallet instead of a cold wallet on the new device, and the mnemonic was imported and used in the wallet on the networked computer. Then yesterday, after downloading the video streaming software OBS for the game live broadcast, I clicked on Google. The sponsored links of the website downloaded malware that gave hackers access to their funds. Yu Xian, the founder of SlowMist, said that the core reason is that the computer runs a game program with a Trojan horse, and then the mnemonic of encrypted assets is connected to the Internet on this computer, so it may be stolen by hackers.\n",

      "Description of the event: According to SlowMist, LendHub, the HECO ecological cross-chain lending platform, was suspected of being attacked and lost nearly 6 million US dollars. The main hacker profit address is 0x9d01..ab03. The reason for this attack is that there are two lBSV cTokens in LendHub, one of which has been abandoned in April 2021 but has not been removed from the market, which resulted in both the old and new lBSV existing in the market. Moreover, the Comptrollers corresponding to the old and new lBSV are not the same, but both have prices in the market, which results in a split in the calculation of liabilities in the old and new markets. Attackers take advantage of this problem to redeem mortgages in the old market and carry out lending operations in the new market, maliciously extorting protocol funds in the new market. At present, the main profit address for hackers is 0x9d01..ab03, and the source of the hacker attack fee is the 100 ETH received from Tornado.Cash on January 12. SlowMist said that through the threat intelligence network, some traces of hackers have been obtained.\n",

The reason for this is that due to the fact that Binance began blocking US IPs in late December, one of Mycelium's three oracle data vendors went offline, and the other vendor also seemed to have gone wrong overnight, resulting in prices relying only on Coinbase and Bitfinex. Coinciding with about 4 pm yesterday, Bitfinex's ETH-USD feed price fluctuated significantly, and the spread was extremely large, perhaps the arbitrage robot detected the spread and began to arbitrage at a higher than usual amount, resulting in a loss of MLP.\n",

To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.</p>\n",

To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.</p>\n",

They said they were cooperating with law enforcement investigating the theft but, to the dismay of some victims, did not describe any plans to compensate those whose assets were lost.</p>\n",

To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.</p>\n",

The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack.
