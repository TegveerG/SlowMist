The pool has an \"emergencyWithdraw\" function that allows users to withdraw their ERC20 token stake immediately. Crucially, however, this feature does not process or interpret NFT stake records. Attackers exploited this flaw by depositing NFTs and ERC20 tokens into a pool and then executing the \"emergencyWithdraw\" function specifically for their ERC20 tokens. By doing so, an attacker can bypass the reward calculation check, effectively manipulating the system to his advantage. Through this manipulation, an attacker is able to clear a user's \"reward debt,\" earn undeserved rewards, and cause significant financial damage to the mining pool and its users.\n",

It's important to underscore that this issue is not exclusive to Klever. Reports indicate that users of multiple wallet providers are affected. All the wallets involved were imported into Klever Wallet K5. These wallets had not been originally created using Klever Wallet K5, instead all the wallets were created using an old and weak pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm as their entropy source. This algorithm was commonly used in early versions of various cryptocurrency wallet providers, which relied on the Javascript platform. The use of such a weak PRNG algorithm can significantly compromise the security and unpredictability of the generated keys, potentially making them more vulnerable to attacks or unauthorized access.

To hide the losses, he provided false documents to inflate the amount of money in his commodity interest pool accounts and provided participants with false account statements. Ichioka also used other participants' funds to pay for the alleged gains. Although Ichioka claimed that he was investing for his clients, he actually used client funds for personal expenses.

      "Blockchain security researcher iczc tweeted that a vulnerability was found in Polygon zkEVM and received a bug bounty from Immunefi L2. The vulnerability prevents asset migration from L1 to L2 by preventing assets bridged from L1 to Polygon zkEVM (L2) from being properly claimed in L2. iczc found in the code logic of processing claim tx pre-execution results that malicious attackers can bypass the \"isReverted\" pre-execution check on claim transactions by setting the gas fee to non-zero, allowing them to send a large number of Low-cost claims DoS attacks on sequencers and validators, increasing computational overhead. Also, transactions are not immediately removed from the pool after execution. The status is updated from Pending to Selected and continues to exist in the PostgreSQL database. Currently, there is only one trusted sequencer capable of fetching transactions from the transaction pool and executing them. Therefore, another vulnerability is to maliciously mark any deposit amount by sending a failed transaction. This will cause claim transactions that correctly use credits to be rejected because the credits are already used. This makes the L2 network unusable for new users. The Polygon zkEVM team fixed this vulnerability by removing the specific gas logic for claiming transactions, with no funds at risk.\n",

      "The DeFi lending protocol Euler Finance was attacked, and the attackers made a profit of about 197 million US dollars. The attacker used flashloans to deposit funds and then leveraged them twice to trigger the liquidation logic, donating the funds to the reserve address and conducting a self-liquidation to collect any remaining assets. Two key factors contributed to the success of the attack: 1. Funds were donated to the reserved address without being subjected to a liquidity check. This created a mechanism that could directly trigger soft liquidation. 2. When the soft liquidation logic was triggered by high leverage, the yield value increased, enabling the liquidator to obtain most of the collateral funds from the liquidated user's account by transferring only a portion of the liabilities to themselves. Given that the value of the collateral funds exceeded the value of the liabilities (which were only partially transferred due to the soft liquidation), the liquidator was able to successfully pass their health factor check (checkLiquidity) and withdraw the obtained funds. On April 4th, Euler Labs tweeted that after a successful negotiation, the attacker has returned all the funds stolen from the agreement on March 13th, because the attacker has returned the funds, the $1 million reward campaign launched by the foundation No new information will be accepted.\n",

It can steal any NFT users listed on Opensea before May 2022 (i.e. before Seaport upgrades), mainly involving the Wyvern protocol, which grants proxy contracts the right to withdraw user NFTs, and this new exploit will Trick the user into signing a transaction, giving the attacker ownership of the user's proxy contract. Cosine, the founder of SlowMist, tweeted that it is necessary to be vigilant about the new use of this old problem, which is related to the old OpenSea protocol, but many users of the old protocol have not cancelled the relevant authorization, and this use is invalid for the new OpenSea protocol (Seaport).\n",

The deposit addresses are signed and delivered to the address issuing server and the addresses are reflected on BiFi only in the case when the signature is verified. In the attack, the server key of the address issuing server was exposed and the attacker was able to self-sign their own deposit address.

To receive the tokens, Wintermute gave Optimism a multi-signature address, to which Optimism transferred 20 million OPs after Optimism test sent two transactions and Wintermute confirmed it was correct. After Optimism transferred the coins, Wintermute found that they had no way to control these coins, because the multi-signature addresses they provided were only deployed on the Ethereum mainnet for the time being and have not yet been deployed to the Optimism network. To gain control of these tokens, Wintermute immediately initiated remediation operations. However, attackers have already noticed this vulnerability and deployed multi-signature to this address on the Optimism network before Wintermute, successfully controlling the 20 million tokens. At present, the Optimism hacker has returned 17 million OP tokens and transferred 1 million OP to the Vitalik address, and Vitalik has returned the funds.\n",

Ultimately, although the funds were withdrawn from the metapool itself, the funds were not lost. When the validator is offline, the address that took the funds from the LP tries to move the funds through the bridge, so the transaction has not yet been processed. However, the validators unanimously decided not to process this transaction because it was malicious to the LP and the entire network: as a result, ~$8.2 million in nUSD was not minted to the attacker's address on the target chain.

      "A vulnerability in NFT marketplace OpenSea resulted in at least 42 NFTs being sent to a burn address, worth at least $100,000. The issue was first raised by Nick Johnson, lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), who noted that when he transferred an ENS domain name (in the form of an NFT), it was transferred to a burn address. This means it was accidentally sent to an uncontrolled address and can no longer be moved. Regarding the destroyed ENS domain name, Johnson said it was the first registered ENS domain name, called rilxxlir.eth, which was held by an ENS account when Johnson registered it with personal funds. In order to transfer the ENS domain name to his own account, he went to OpenSea to perform the transfer, only to find that it had been sent to a destruction address by mistake. Since Johnson is still the controller of the ENS domain name, he can still make changes, just cannot move the domain name. Johnson then received further reports from others who were similarly affected and compiled a list of 32 affected transactions involving 42 NFTs. Most NFTs use the ERC-721 standard, but a few use ERC-1155. He looked at the floor price of each NFT, which totaled about $100,000. Johnson claims that OpenSea has now fixed the vulnerability.\n",

During the deployment of the upgradeable smart contract, the dYdX security module made an error, which caused the ratio of DYDX to stkDYDX to change from 1 to 0, so that users who pledged DYDX did not receive stkDYDX. dYdX stated that the error was caused by an error in the smart contract deployment process. It believed that there was no error in the code itself. The security module was previously audited by the smart contract, and based on the liquidity module design, the design was also audited. The security module is thoroughly tested before deployment. At present, user funds are safely locked in the security module until the end of the 28-day epoch, and no security module rewards are distributed and no withdrawals are possible. In order to restore the contract function, an upgrade is required. The suggested solution is to restore the security module function, allow the pledged user to retrieve the funds, and compensate the user for the wrong reward for participating in the security module.\n",

The survey showed that the liquidator made a profit of about 20 million U.S. dollars, and the seller made a profit of about 55 million U.S. dollars; the \"scalper\" made a profit of about 2 million U.S. dollars; the 0xef044 address account had a net loss of about 66 million U.S. dollars. Secondly, its address attribution is based on the Swipe escrow address used on Binance, so there is no insider trading. The agreement lost approximately $77 million due to market fluctuations. VGP will recover approximately US$77 million from the distribution fund, and formulate a community recovery plan for XVS holders and others in the form of airdrops from the distribution fund and agreement income.\n",

In this regard, Aeternity Chaohua Community Moderator \"February Honghong\" said that 51% attacks will not create new tokens.

The decision to trigger the moratorium came after a major issue with the redemption flow of the contract that put open deposit signer deposits at risk of liquidation. The team summarizes as follows: 1. First, the Keep team failed to conduct more tests after the new commit was proposed. As a result, the team missed the opportunity to catch this issue during development. 2. During the dApp-based manual QA process, the Keep team did not verify whether a successful exchange in the UI resulted in a closed deposit on-chain. As a result, the team missed the opportunity to find issues during the manual QA process. 3. The Keep team did not adequately consider input validation at the entry point of redemption. This is one of the relatively few pieces of data in the system that is completely user-controlled, and should therefore be a top consideration for input validation. 4.

About two hours after the theft, wojak, the owner of THeRTT**, who transferred the 26.73 million TRX address, appeared. According to wojak, he wrote a script to analyze the bytecode of the TRON virtual machine, scan the contracts in batches and initiate transactions to see if there is any way to make money, but accidentally hit a bug in the Tronbank contract. At first he didn't even know that the money came from Tronbank. Some people in the community suggested that wojak return the money to the Tronbank developers, but wojak believes that this is not his problem. Developers should write test examples, do audits, and at least run some formal verifications (obviously they didn’t do anything). He is willing to return the money intact to every investor in Tronbank, not the developer of the project. Based on the available information, it is still too early to conclude that \"the developer placed a backdoor in the contract\". There are only two objective conclusions that can be drawn at present: 1. TRX Pro has a backdoor in the contract on the main network; 2. The code certified on TSC does not match the actual contract operation logic.\n",
