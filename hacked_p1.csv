"2023-07-03","AzukiDao","After spending nearly $40 million on a new set of Azuki NFTs, the Azuki community was outraged that they were ""diluting"" a near-replica of the original Azuki collection. To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,” holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft.","$ 69,000","Contract variable not checked","https://twitter.com/wublockchain12/status/1675804855414452225"
