All wallets affected by the suspicious activity on July 12 were reported to be affected by a known vulnerability caused by low-entropy mnemonics. It's important to underscore that this issue is not exclusive to Klever. Reports indicate that users of multiple wallet providers are affected. All the wallets involved were imported into Klever Wallet K5. These wallets had not been originally created using Klever Wallet K5, instead all the wallets were created using an old and weak pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm as their entropy source. This algorithm was commonly used in early versions of various cryptocurrency wallet providers, which relied on the Javascript platform. The use of such a weak PRNG algorithm can significantly compromise the security and unpredictability of the generated keys, potentially making them more vulnerable to attacks or unauthorized access. Klever strongly recommends immediately migrating old wallets to new wallets created on Klever Wallet K5 or Klever Safe.",-,Vulnerabilities caused by low-entropy mnemonics,https://klever.org/en/blog/klever-alert-external-security-incident

2023-05-29,Polygon zkEVM,"Blockchain security researcher iczc tweeted that a vulnerability was found in Polygon zkEVM and received a bug bounty from Immunefi L2. The vulnerability prevents asset migration from L1 to L2 by preventing assets bridged from L1 to Polygon zkEVM (L2) from being properly claimed in L2. iczc found in the code logic of processing claim tx pre-execution results that malicious attackers can bypass the ""isReverted"" pre-execution check on claim transactions by setting the gas fee to non-zero, allowing them to send a large number of Low-cost claims DoS attacks on sequencers and validators, increasing computational overhead. Also, transactions are not immediately removed from the pool after execution. The status is updated from Pending to Selected and continues to exist in the PostgreSQL database. Currently, there is only one trusted sequencer capable of fetching transactions from the transaction pool and executing them. Therefore, another vulnerability is to maliciously mark any deposit amount by sending a failed transaction. This will cause claim transactions that correctly use credits to be rejected because the credits are already used. This makes the L2 network unusable for new users. The Polygon zkEVM team fixed this vulnerability by removing the specific gas logic for claiming transactions, with no funds at risk.",-,Code Logic Vulnerabilities,https://twitter.com/0xiczc/status/1662090451493740545

This created a mechanism that could directly trigger soft liquidation. 2. When the soft liquidation logic was triggered by high leverage, the yield value increased, enabling the liquidator to obtain most of the collateral funds from the liquidated user's account by transferring only a portion of the liabilities to themselves. Given that the value of the collateral funds exceeded the value of the liabilities (which were only partially transferred due to the soft liquidation), the liquidator was able to successfully pass their health factor check (checkLiquidity) and withdraw the obtained funds.

Moreover, the Comptrollers corresponding to the old and new lBSV are not the same, but both have prices in the market, which results in a split in the calculation of liabilities in the old and new markets.

At the time of the release of OP tokens, Optimism entrusted Wintermute to provide liquidity services for OP in the secondary market. As part of the agreement, Optimism will provide Wintermute with 20 million OP tokens. To receive the tokens, Wintermute gave Optimism a multi-signature address, to which Optimism transferred 20 million OPs after Optimism test sent two transactions and Wintermute confirmed it was correct. After Optimism transferred the coins, Wintermute found that they had no way to control these coins, because the multi-signature addresses they provided were only deployed on the Ethereum mainnet for the time being and have not yet been deployed to the Optimism network. To gain control of these tokens, Wintermute immediately initiated remediation operations. However, attackers have already noticed this vulnerability and deployed multi-signature to this address on the Optimism network before Wintermute, successfully controlling the 20 million tokens. At present, the Optimism hacker has returned 17 million OP tokens and transferred 1 million OP to the Vitalik address, and Vitalik has returned the funds.",2000000,Multi-signature address transfer vulnerability,https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1534631766576836608

This means it was accidentally sent to an uncontrolled address and can no longer be moved. Regarding the destroyed ENS domain name, Johnson said it was the first registered ENS domain name, called rilxxlir.eth, which was held by an ENS account when Johnson registered it with personal funds. In order to transfer the ENS domain name to his own account, he went to OpenSea to perform the transfer, only to find that it had been sent to a destruction address by mistake. Since Johnson is still the controller of the ENS domain name, he can still make changes, just cannot move the domain name. Johnson then received further reports from others who were similarly affected and compiled a list of 32 affected transactions involving 42 NFTs.

At first he didn't even know that the money came from Tronbank. Some people in the community suggested that wojak return the money to the Tronbank developers, but wojak believes that this is not his problem. Developers should write test examples, do audits, and at least run some formal verifications (obviously they didn’t do anything). He is willing to return the money intact to every investor in Tronbank, not the developer of the project.
